Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that makes it easier to teach digital design and practical to get those designs manufactured onto real chips.

Our pricing model makes it easy to put many designs onto one chip that is then shared between students.

> Hi, I'm a professor for an Introduction to Digital Systems course and just found this and let's just say this has **fundamentally just changed our entire Computer Engineering curriculum**. It looks like we can actually have first-year students designing ASICs, then be able later to analyze performance while taking their electronics course and learning about MOSFETs as well as their embedded systems and computer architecture.

# Advice for High schools

## Preparation

* Watch the [introduction video](https://youtu.be/f4w1QOpHzOo)
* Complete some of the [digital design classes](/digital_design/)
* Create a new design or use one of our [customisable projects](/tags/customisable/)
* Create the [GDS files needed for manufacture](https://tinytapeout.com/#get-your-submission-ready)
* Have a look through the [frequently asked questions](/faq)

## Teaching

* Participants need a laptop and ideally headphones and a mouse.
* Use the [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHFC3NHHFAzqK8HMGjxMHXJJ6r4j15dY86nk-boGDNM) to explain how the program will work.
* Students should complete the digital guide.
* Confident students can make their own designs. 
* Students who need more help can customise one of the [customisable projects](/tags/customisable/)

## Submission

* Either submit the participant's designs yourself with a credit card or contact us to get prepaid tokens.
* This is a new program, and we're still unsure how long order fulfillment will take, but it's likely to be 12 months.
* While you are waiting, you can use [SiliWiz](/siliwiz) to teach how semiconductors are used to make the digital building blocks you used in the workshop. 

# Advice for Universities

## Preparation

* Watch the [introduction video](https://youtu.be/f4w1QOpHzOo)
* Check the [HDL notes](/hdl/)
* Try the flow with a simple FPGA project
* Create the [GDS files needed for manufacture](https://tinytapeout.com/#get-your-submission-ready)
* Have a look through the [frequently asked questions](/faq)
