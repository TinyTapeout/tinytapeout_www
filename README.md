## Developing the cloudflare functions (dynamic content)

You'll need a recent version of node.js and npm. First, install wrangler:

```bash
npm i -g wrangler
```

Then, you can run the functions locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: for the static content to be served correctly, you need to run `hugo` first (or `hugo -w` to watch for changes).

## Adding redirects

Add a line to static/_redirects
