## Design some stickers for a chance to win a prize!

We're planning to make some new stickers to promote Tiny Tapeout, and though it would be cool to ask our community
to submit their designs!

The designs must be related to Tiny Tapeout in some way, and include any of the following:
- Tiny Tapeout logo artwork
- The words "Tiny Tapeout"
- A link to [tinytapeout.com](https://tinytapeout.com)
- Relevant words or phrases to open-source silicon, for example:
    - "Making Silicon Accessible"
    - "I say Tiny, you say Tapeout"
- Anything you can think of that is cool and related to what we do :)

### Sticker details
Two styles of stickers are available, as shown below. They can be any shape, minimum 40mm and maximum 100mm in both
width and length.
