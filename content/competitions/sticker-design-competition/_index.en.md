## Design some stickers for a chance to win a prize!

We're planning to make some new stickers to promote Tiny Tapeout, and thought it would be cool to ask our community
to submit their designs!

The designs must be related to Tiny Tapeout in some way, and include any of the following:
- Tiny Tapeout logo artwork
- The words "Tiny Tapeout"
- A link to [tinytapeout.com](https://tinytapeout.com)
- Relevant words or phrases to open-source silicon, for example:
    - "Making Silicon Accessible"
    - "I say Tiny, you say Tapeout"
- Anything you can think of that is cool and related to what we do :)
