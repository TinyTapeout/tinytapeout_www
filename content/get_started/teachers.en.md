Tiny Tapeout is designed to be accessible to all, regardless of previous experience in semiconductor design. With browser-based tools and an open source build system, Tiny Tapeout vastly reduces the barrier to entry - and costs - associated with experimental chip design and tapeout.

For educators, Tiny Tapeout offers a unique opportunity to give students hands-on experience with building their own application-specific integrated circuits and taking them all the way through to production - with the goal of holding a fully-packaged and ready-to-use chip in their hand at the end of the process.

Using a multi-project chip architecture, Tiny Tapeout delivers hardware at the lowest possible cost. The chips produced during each run include a copy of all submitted projects, selectable using the custom carrier board - meaning costs can be reduced still further by allowing individuals to submit unique projects then share hardware for group testing.

> I'm a professor for an Introduction to Digital Systems course and just found this and let's just say this has **fundamentally just changed our entire Computer Engineering curriculum**. It looks like we can actually have first-year students designing ASICs, then be able later to analyse performance while taking their electronics course and learning about MOSFETs as well as their embedded systems and computer architecture.

# Teaching with Tiny Tapeout

If you're interested in using Tiny Tapeout with your students, we recommend [watching our introductory video](https://youtu.be/f4w1QOpHzOo).

Students and classes participating in Tiny Tapout will need access to a laptop or desktop, headphones, and an internet connection. Our [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHFC3NHHFAzqK8HMGjxMHXJJ6r4j15dY86nk-boGDNM) provide an overview of how a Tiny Tapeout run works, while our [digital design tutorial](/digital_design/) provides a user-friendly introduction to chip design using our browser-based Wokwi tool.

While confident students are welcome to create their designs from scratch, we also offer a selection of [customisable projects](/tags/customisable/) for those who need a hand getting started. For classes who want a lower-level understanding of exactly how semiconductors work we offer the interactive [SiliWiz](/siliwiz) silicon design simulator.

## For High Schools

Tiny Tapeout's browser-based software and automated build system is designed to offer as low a barrier to entry as possible, while our educational materials begin at a level assuming no prior experience with chip design.

For high school and secondary education teachers looking to introduce Tiny Tapeout into their curriculum, we recommend [watching our introductory video](https://youtu.be/f4w1QOpHzOo) and completing at least some of our [digital design tutorial](/digital_design/) to get a feel for how Wokwi works. Once you're confident with Wokwi, try creating a new design or use one of our [customisable projects](/tags/customisable/) as a quick-start platform before [trying out the submission process](/#get-your-submission-ready).

When introducing a new class to Tiny Tapeout, we recommend beginning with our [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NHFC3NHHFAzqK8HMGjxMHXJJ6r4j15dY86nk-boGDNM) and having the students complete our [digital design tutorial](/digital_design/). As it's browser-based, you won't need to install any software: students can complete the tutorial using a web browser.

When students have completed their chip designs, whether wholly original or using our [customisable project library](/tags/customisable/), you can submit them for production using a credit card - or contact us to purchase prepaid tokens.

## For Universities

To run a Tiny Tapeout course at a university level for students with prior experience in hardware design languages (HDLs), you can refer to our [HDL documentation](/hdl/) - though the [digital design tutorial](/digital_design/) is available for students with less experience, while [SiliWiz](/siliwiz) provides a hands-on look at how semiconductors work at the lowest level.

We recommend experimenting with the Tiny Tapeout design flow using a simple FPGA project to begin, before [trying out the submission process](/submission/).

When students have completed their chip designs, whether wholly original or using our [customisable project library](/tags/customisable/), you can submit them for production using a credit card - or contact us to purchase prepaid tokens.
