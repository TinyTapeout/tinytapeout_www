Tiny Tapeout helps you create, manufacture, and share your own custom chips (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs). For the first time makers, students, and small companies can create their own chips without breaking the bank, signing non-disclosure agreements, or needing a PhD in semiconductor design - but if you have one, that's cool too.

You can get your design made for at little as $150, using open source tools and a community of experts to help you along the way. We're here to help you get started, and to make sure you have the resources you need to make a successful tapeout.

Tiny Tapeout is designed to be accessible to all, whether you're an absolute novice to chip design or you have years of experience with Hardware Design Languages (HDLs). If you're a teacher or lecturer in the topic, you'll also find Tiny Tapeout an invaluable educational resource.
