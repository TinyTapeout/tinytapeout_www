Welcome to the fascinating world of semiconductor design. We're excited to have you here.

Tiny Tapeout is made to be accessible, even if you've never even thought about how an electronic chip works - much less thought about designing your own. Using an automated build system and the user-friendly Wokwi design tool, you can learn as you go along without having to dive deep into the nitty-gritty - unless you want to, of course.
 
To begin, we recommend following our [digital design tutorial](digital_design), where you'll learn about logic gates, flip-flops, and more through our web-based, interactive design tool, Wokwi. We've seen students go through the tutorial and create their first digital design in just one evening - but it's okay to take your time, don't rush, enjoy the process!

After you've experimented with the capabilities of Wokwi you can learn how to submit your design in our [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCGPKdmM3Dc) and become part of the growing number of chip design newcomers who can hold their creations in the palm of their hands.

If you'd like to dig deeper in to the inner workings of semiconductors and how Tiny Tapeout takes your project from Wokwi to manufacture, the following resources will help:

* Learn how semiconductors work at the most fundamental level using [our interactive tool SiliWiz](siliwiz).
* Find out how our design flow converts your Wokwi project into a production-ready submission to a semiconductor fab [using open-source tools and the GitHub Actions system](making_asics).
