# From idea to chip design in minutes!

Tiny Tapeout helps you create, manufacture, and share your own custom chips (ASICs). For the first time, makers, students, and small companies can create their own chips without breaking the bank, signing NDAs, and needing a PhD in semiconductor design (but if you have one, that’s cool too).

{{< youtube qVWq_XZko-M >}}

You can get your design made for at little as $150, using open source tools and a community of experts to help you along the way. We’re here to help you get started, and to make sure you have the resources you need to make a successful tapeout.

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that makes it easier and cheaper than ever to get your designs manufactured on a real chip! See what other people are making by [taking a look at what was submitted for the last run](/runs/tt05).

# Get started

Tiny Tapeout is designed to be accessible to all, whether you're an absolute novice to chip design or you have years of experience with Hardware Design Languages (HDLs). If you're a teacher or lecturer in the topic, you'll also find Tiny Tapeout an invaluable educational resource.

# Testimonials

> Just made a 4-bit barrel shifter by using this http://tinytapeout.com toolkit. It's quick and fun to use. The GDS even generated within minutes. Everyone should try this.

> Thank you for doing it - I always wanted to join these OpenMPW shuttles, but never felt ready for it. Tiny Tapeout provided a way for me to get in, while only spending 2 evening of effort on my end. That's amazing!

> Just yesterday, I was dreaming of a tapeout cooperative, and it turns out to exist. Thanks to you all!! Looking forward to TT05!
