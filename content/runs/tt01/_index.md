## Launch stats

* Launched: 2022-08-17
* Submission closed: 2022-09-01
* Submitted to Efabless 2022-09-05 for the [MPW7 shuttle](https://efabless.com/shuttle-status) using Skywater 130nm open source PDK
* Chips expected November 2023. As this was a trial run, we are not expecting to manufacture or deliver PCBs

## Project statistics

* 152 projects submitted. Each project is 100um x 100um
* 100 people willing to pay $100 for the chip mounted on a PCB.
* 115 used Wokwi graphical editor, 31 Verilog, 3 XLS, 2 Chisel, 1 Amaranth
* 15k standard cells used across all projects.
* Most cells used in a design was 600, the least was 14.
* Total wire length 772 mm.

## Testimonials / Endorsements

I want to change my VLSI class in the spring (April-June) to utilise your tiny chip infrastructure. If I could say every student in my class got something made, that would be awesome.

I teach digital design in UAE and would be keen to get in contact and learn about the next submission date where my students could submit their test structures for tapeout.

---
I am a CS and EE teacher and in my final year as a PhD student at the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN). Since we teach courses on both digital and analog electronics, I thought it would be a great opportunity for students to materialise their work.

Built a CRC logic for the http://tinytapeout.com of @matthewvenn with my son. Looking forward if the tapeout happens ðŸ¥° Yet either way, the workflow is astonishing. CI/CD for chip design ðŸ¤¯

Thank you for doing it - I always wanted to join these OpenMPW shuttles, but never felt ready for it. TinyTapeout provided a way for me to get in, while only spending 1 evening of effort on my end. That's amazing! 

---
Just made a 4-bit barrel shifter by using this http://tinytapeout.com toolkit. It's quick and fun to use. The GDS even generated within minutes. Everyone should try this.
