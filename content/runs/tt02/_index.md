We’re getting ready to open for submissions for TinyTapeout-02 in early November. 

There will be limited spots - so sign up to the mailing list to make sure you don't miss your chance to submit a design.

> **Testimonial** Built a CRC logic for the http://tinytapeout.com of @matthewvenn with my son. Looking forward if the tapeout happens 🥰 Yet either way, the workflow is astonishing. CI/CD for chip design 🤯
