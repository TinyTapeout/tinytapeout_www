# Get your Tiny Tapeout submission repository ready
Tiny Tapeout takes advantage of GitHub repositories to streamline the submission process. Using automated checks called *GitHub Actions*, you can submit your design for tapeout in just a few minutes! 

Plus, you get interesting statistics about your design, like how many [cells](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/standardcell/) you used, as well as [3D renderings](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/post/3drendering/) of your [GDS](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/gds2/) files!

**Submission Overview**

Here are the basic steps for submitting. Please watch the YouTube video for a quick, detailed walkthrough.

    * Create a design using a [high-level design language (HDL)](/hdl/)
3. Fork the [GitHub submission template](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt02-submission-template) (a *fork* is a just a copy of a repository)
    * Not familiar with GitHub? Don't worry, Matt's walkthrough video walks you through each step.
