### How it works

The module (Fig. 1) is fed by two fixed-point numbers, namely af and bf, coverts them into the posit arithmetic [1] format (ap and bp) and sums them to produce a posit output (sp).

![fixed2posit-module drawio](https://github.com/afasolino/tt06_posit/assets/151364130/2e2fa7f1-4080-490b-bbb9-8ac1b462cae2)

It is made of two units:
1.

1) 16-bit 2's complement fixed-point 0.15 coded to 16-bit standard posit (16,1) converter, namely fixed to posit converter,
2) posit adder, that executes the addition of posit numbers according to the posit standard.

The conversion is operated as described in [1], leveraging a leading zero counter [2] and some glue logic.

2. The addition leverages the architecture presented in [3].

### How to test

Provide two fixed-point input data and they will be added in posit arithmetic.
